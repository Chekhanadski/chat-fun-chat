## Description
Welcome to our Fun Chat Application! This app is designed to provide a basic and user-friendly platform for real-time communication between users.

## Available Scripts in the Project

This project includes several scripts for development, building, testing, and code formatting. Here's a brief overview of each script and its usage:

### start

```sh
npm run start
```

This script starts the development server.

### build

```sh
npm run build
```

This script creates a production-ready build of the application.

### test

```sh
npm run test
```

This script runs the test suite using Jest. Use this to run all tests in the project and ensure that all code changes are working as expected.

### validate

```sh
npm run validate
```

This script validates the branch naming to local convention.

### lint

```sh
npm run lint
```

This script runs ESLint on the codebase. Use this to catch and fix syntax errors, find problematic patterns, and enforce code style.

### format

```sh
npm run format
```

This script formats the codebase using Prettier. Use this to enforce a consistent code style across the project.
